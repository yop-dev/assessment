## ü§ñ AI Usage Log

### Primary Tools

- **WARP (Claude Sonnet - Opus too expensive)** - Main development assistant for code generation, debugging, and architectural decisions
- **FIGMA MCP** - For extracting design specifications and assets from Figma files
- **ChatGPT** - Additional support for specific implementation details

  
### AI-Code Fixed

- I just let AI fix the errors it gave
- I sometimes manually adjust the width and height of the cards


### Key Prompts Used

#### Prompt #1 - Project Foundation

```
We will recreate designs with meticulous attention to detail. Ensure the UI is pixel-perfect and maintains the original figma style. Convert it into a functional Next.js application -- using react with typescript, tailwind css, and also use shadcn UI components, follow software engineering best practices, you also have mcp tools such as context7 and sequential thinking along with the figma mcp that you can use when applicable. Please make sure that the code is clean, maintainable, modular, and readable, the components should be dynamic as well. The project is a frontend design for a campaign creation flow with progress stepper, and will have different screens but on just one page, we will create one screen at a time so make sure to structure the code to have proper navigations/placeholders.

Include:
- A top-down layout flow
- Accurate spacing and alignment
- Original font-sizes and weights
- Correct testing for cross-browser compatibility

Additional requirements:
- Optimize for responsiveness across devices
- Ensure accessibility standards (WCAG) are met
- Add comments for clarity and maintainability
- Include testing for cross-browser compatibility
```

#### Prompt #2 - Campaign Type Selection

```
Inside the "1. Choose Campaign Type" card are three buttons:
1. Sending/Gifting (with a gift icon above)
2. Paid Promotion (with a dollar icon above)
3. Other (add any icon you see fit)

Also on the very left side, there is a sidebar-nav, which has (+) button (message) button, etc.
use only black/white/gray colors for this

Here is the figma link you can follow: [Figma URL]
```

#### Other Key Prompts

- **Step 2 Implementation**: "for step number 2, '2. Add Campaign Information', there will be two sub-pages 'new product' and 'existing products', let us work on the 'new product' for now, we can paste product URL as well as upload PDF/CSV files"
- **Existing Products Page**: "let's move on, this will be the last page we are creating and we will move on to polishing what we did this is the 'existing products' sub-page, as you can see it has a list of existing placeholder products and there is no next button, instead it is replaced by a 'scan' button"
- **Responsive Design**: "I manually just adjusted it, now please make the entire page responsive across dimensions"

## üé® Design Decisions

### Technology Stack

- **Next.js 15** with App Router for modern React development
- **TypeScript** for type safety and better developer experience
- **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first styling and responsive design
- **ShadCN UI Components** - The original Figma design looked like a great opportunity to use ShadCN UI components, providing consistent, accessible, and well-designed components out of the box
- **Lucide React** for consistent iconography

### Architecture Decisions

- **Single Page Application**: Implemented as a multi-step wizard on one page with state management for smooth user experience
- **Component-Based Architecture**: Modular, reusable components for maintainability
- **Mobile-First Responsive Design**: Progressive enhancement from mobile to desktop
- **Gradient Border Implementation**: Custom gradient border around the campaign card for visual appeal

### UI/UX Decisions

- **Progress Stepper**: Visual progress indicator with check marks for completed steps
- **Tab-Based Navigation**: For switching between "New Product" and "Existing Products"
- **Drag & Drop File Upload**: Intuitive file upload experience
- **Responsive Grid Layout**: Campaign type buttons adapt from 1 column (mobile) to 3 columns (desktop)
- **Consistent Spacing**: Used Tailwind's spacing scale for consistent visual hierarchy

### Design Philosophy

**"In my mind I just followed what the Figma design looked like"** - Maintained pixel-perfect fidelity to the original design while ensuring modern web standards and accessibility.
